coder@architect: Thank you for the suggestion. That's a good idea to make the `init()` method more flexible. I have updated the `init()` method to accept a parameter for the canvas ID:

```javascript
init(canvasId) {
  this.canvas = document.getElementById(canvasId);
  if (!this.canvas) {
    throw new Error(`Canvas element with ID ${canvasId} not found`);
  }
  this.ctx = this.canvas.getContext('2d');
  this.width = this.canvas.width;
  this.height = this.canvas.height;
}
```

Now, the `init()` method can be called with the ID of the canvas element to use:

```javascript
const game = new GameEngine();
game.init('canvas1');
```

Thank you for your help and suggestions. Let me know if you have any other feedback or suggestions.
